- [ ] Allow users to label their tasks with a status (ex: to do, doing, done)
- [ ] Display the tasks, with their remaining time. For instance, if today is the 15th of March and the task is due for the 20th of March, display in 5 days.
- [ ] Allow users to sort their tasks by remainining time, with the most urgent first, or by name.
- [ ] Filter tasks (ex: only show "to do" tasks)
- [ ] BONUS: Save tasks in LocalStorage, so that they persist even when the page is refreshed.
